# AIR QUALITY SENSING USING MACHINE LEARNING
This project is done as part of the Future Ready Talent Virtual Internship Program organised by Microsoft.
### PROBLEM STATEMENT:-
Continued exposure to surroundings with poor air quality is a major public health concern in developed and developing
countries. It's estimated that the adulterants responsible for poor air quality cause nearly 2.5 million unseasonable
deaths per time world-wide. Significantly, around 1.5 million of these deaths are due to weakened inner air, and it's
suggested that poor inner air quality may pose a significant health threat to further than half of the world's population.
Due to its link with industrialization, societal health problems related to poor air quality disproportionately affects
developed and developing nations - it's estimated that pollution is to blame for unseasonable deaths. Through this web application, we will aim to resolve such critical problems and will thereby help a young life live longer.
