# AIR QUALITY SENSING USING MACHINE LEARNING

PROBLEM STATEMENT:-

Continued exposure to surroundings with poor air quality is a major public health concern in developed and developing
countries. It's estimated that the adulterants responsible for poor air quality cause nearly 2.5 million unseasonable
deaths per time world-wide. Significantly, around 1.5 million of these deaths are due to weakened inner air, and it's
suggested that poor inner air quality may pose a significant health threat to further than half of the world's population.
Due to its link with industrialisation, societal health problems associated with poor air quality disproportionately affects
developed and developing nations - it's estimated that air pollution is responsible for the unseasonable deaths.
